Usage of a mobile for payment and banking transactions (mobile-banking) has been rapid, and has extended access in many developing countries like India. In electronic commerce, customers use electronic money (e-money) instead of cash. But, now day’s customers want more reliable, easy, robust and responsive applications which will full fill their requirement. Keeping this in mind we will be addressing below business problems in our application:

a.	Quick and easy fund transfer: 
Fund transfer can be possible within a minute if sender and receiver are physically near to each other. This can be achieved without adding a payee by obtaining user account details through scanning unique generated QR code on the receiver’s app.

b.	Improved service locator: 
Using latest technology we can improve Bank and ATM locators i.e. by showing ICICI branches and ATM’s in whichever direction mobile is pointed. The process would be intuitive, fun, time saving and effective.

c.	Simplified and interactive banking experience:
Customizable menu in home page, interactive user interface and appealing UX makes entire experience of using the app trouble free, quick and easy, hence the name Quicksy.
